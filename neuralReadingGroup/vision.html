        <h3>Vision Statement and Plan for Neural Algorithms Reading Group</h3>
		
		<strong>Models, algorithms, complexity:</strong>

<ul>
		<li>We want to develop an algorithmic theory for brain networks:  Define  
		simple formal models, design algorithms, and prove lower bounds.</li>

		<li>The networks are supposed to be abstract versions of networks that  
		arise in brains.  Thus, bio-plausibility is important; in particular,  
		the algorithms should be distributed, with local decisions like those  
		made in real brain networks.</li>

		<li>To make the models usable for theoretical analysis, the models will  
		have to abstract away many detailed features of brain networks;  
		however, we want them to retain key, important features of real brain  
		networks so that they could conceivably be used to explain what  
		happens in real brain computation.</li>

		<li>Specifically, we are considering a model for brain networks that is  
		based on discrete spiking events.  To make things simple and  
		tractable, we will generally consider synchronous rounds.  The models  
		will usually (but not always) be stochastic.  Thus, these are  
		synchronous, stochastic Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).</li>

		<li>We will consider several cost measures.  Size of network, e.g., number  
		of auxiliary neurons, range of values for the weights.  Time to  
		converge to an answer.  Length of time that the answer remains stable.  
		  Energy usage, as measure by amount of spiking.</li>

		<li>We hope that these models and measures will give us a new type of  
		theory for brain computation.  We hope that it will be elegant, and  
		perhaps more expressive than previous theories, e.g., those using  
		rate-based differential-equation models.  We hope that algorithms  
		expressed within these models will be amenable to the usual sorts of  
		algorithmic, distributed-computing-theory analysis.  We hope that they  
		will be able to reach similar conclusions from those that have  
		appeared in papers using previous models (such as rate-based), only  
		now proved using discrete methods.  But perhaps we can get new types  
		of results as well, because of the extra power of discrete events,  
		synchrony, and stochasticity.</li>
		
		<li> One approach that we will take from theoretical computer science which is less common in other areas is that, once we have fixed a model of neural computation and a neurally motivated computational problem, we will allow ourselves free reign to design algorithms (i.e., networks) in this model that solve the problem as efficiently as possible. Even if these algorithms themselves are not biologically plausible, this is a useful exercise. If they are not plausible, why not? Is there something we should add to the model to capture this? Are there additional cost measures that biological systems may be optimizing that we are not considering? Are there simpler, more biologically plausible mechanisms that achieve similar complexity?
		</li>
</ul>

		<strong>What we will cover:</strong>
		
		<ul>

		<li>1.  Models:  Review the models we have defined so far, and some  
		possible embellishments and variations.  Also visit some alternatives  
		(Maass, models with different kinds of history, Poisson instead of  
		synchronous, rate-based).</li>
</ul>
		Then we will move on to particular problems that could be studied in  
		such networks:
<ul>
		<li>2.  Problems of focus and attention, selection (e.g., WTA).</li>

		<li>3.  Problems of neural coding and recognition.</li>

		<li>4.  Problems of learning.</li>
	</ul>
